It was 20th December, 6 AM in the morning. I woke up with a little paranoia. "Am I afraid to get badly beaten up? no not really, Am I afraid of defeat? not true either, but I am utterly terrified of being humiliated in front of a crowd. And there is a high probability that it might happen today".

These were my thoughts when I woke up. It was the Bangabandu 2020 National Boxing Tournament and I was a participant. It's not that I didn't work hard, I did, but I did not work hard enough and I knew It. I used to go to the boxing stadium everyday and train for 2-3 hours straight, but right before the tournament my office work pressure tripled, I had to conduct some interviews and as a result missed 5/6 important sparring sessions. With that my confidence plummeted and all my hopes of being a champion evaporated.

Buut I don't quit. Nope, no matter how hard it is. So I got up and sat down and wrote the following in my notes app.
"Who would we be,
If we gave up
On the days when we were not strong enough.
Or on the days
When we were not brave enough."

And with that I opened the door and left home to fight a war. :D

If you know about Murphy's law you know that something crazy is bound to happen on your important day. So in accordance with that, I had a small bike accident on my way to the stadium.
